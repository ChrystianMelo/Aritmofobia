# Aritmofobia
Steven Jodds has a peculiar disorder: he has a phobia of odd numbers. Fortunately, this problem has not prevented him from becoming a successful entrepreneur and traveling throughout the country to hold meetings with clients. Unfortunately, Steve is also afraid of traveling by plane and needs to make all his trips by car.

Steve wants to create an algorithm to better plan his trips. However, due to his aversion to odd numbers, he has never been able to learn how to program. Therefore, he has asked for the help of an excellent programmer - you - to assist him in this task. Steve wants to create an algorithm that determines the shortest path between two cities, given a graph that represents the network of cities and roads that interconnect the region. However, his algorithm must take into consideration Steve's peculiarities:

Steve only travels between two adjacent cities if the road connecting the two cities has an even length;
The path traced by the algorithm must pass through an even number of roads.
